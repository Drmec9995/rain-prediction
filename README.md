# rain-prediction
Rain is one of the most crucial resources in the existence of human being, rain has been what almost all our activities depends on. The ability to predict the time and day rain will fall is a very interesting part of technology, this ability has given us opportunities to know, when, where rain will likely fall, which make us plan ahead of the event.


more importantly, we all know that rain is important to agricultiural production, especially crop production, tha ability to predict rainfall will give us an edge in this particular aspect of agriculture.

the following are the importance of rainfall to agriculture.
* It makes us predict the season to cultivate some crops
* It helps us to make quick decison on where best to plant some specific crop.
* It helps us to know if like flood is going to occur in a particular area or not.
* It help us know the best time to rear poultry chicks and other birds.
* It help us to know the suitable time to reduce the water level in our pond to aviod rain flushing our fishes.
* It prepare our mind for better planning of the farming activities etc..


with all this information about the importance of rain fall prediction, i thing its time to proceed with the project.


#### Problem Statment:

let say you plan to travel to another state with your luggage, and it rains the next day.
It will be very disheartening because your luggage will also be wet and also it will likely slow down your travelling. 
what if we could predict whether it will rain or not the next day, it would be very helpful to us. 

#### A project on predicting whether it will rain tomorrow or not by using the Rainfall in Australia dataset
This project is tested over lot of ml models like catboost, xgboost, random forest, support vector classifier, etc..
Out of these models catboost and XGboost performed very well giving an AUC score around and ROC score of 89 far better than others.
